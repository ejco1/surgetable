# Ethan's Surge Table Program
This was made in collaboration with a friend Bri and her Custom Surge Table for use in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition.
The purpose of the program is to create an easier method to index, roll on the main table, and also to roll on subsets of the table based on the intensity modifiers.

## Steps to Installation
### 1. You're going to need to make sure that you have Python downloaded onto your computer.
	- You can check by opening your command prompt ( Start -> Search: Command Prompt ) and typing the command below
```bash
python
```
If you have it, you can exit the python prompt by inputting
```python
exit()
```
If you don't have it..
You can find it here at: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 2. Download the required dependencies.
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install openpyxl
```
At the end of these commands, they should each say something along the lines of, "Successfully installed ..."
### 3. Run the Program!
You're finally at the end of the installation sequence, and the last thing to do is to run the program itself.
```bash
python SurgeTable.py
```
Or, you could just double click 'SurgeTable.bat'.

## For Wider Use:
You can really just plug in your own version of a Wild Magic Table given that you give the table 3 Columns, an 'Index', an 'Effect' and an 'Intensity'
You can find the wild_magic.xlsx file in the "Inner Files" folder, and you can modify it to your own uses.
Of course, the same can be said for the script itself, I guess.

## Quality of Life Technique
If you 'Create a Shortcut' of  "SurgeTable.bat", you'll be able to open the program wherever you decide to put the shortcut. I like mine in main Folder, but that's up to you. Name it whatever you want, I don't care. lol
